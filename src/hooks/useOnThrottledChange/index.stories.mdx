# useOnThrottledChange

Helps you implement a throttle / debounce approach, as explained here: 
https://www.peterbe.com/plog/how-to-throttle-and-debounce-an-autocomplete-input-in-react

```
// Usage
const [throttleCallback] = useOnThrottledChange(onThrottledChange);
<input onChange={throttleCallback} />

// Alternative Usage if you would also like to continue to call the non throttled version in addition
const [throttleCallback] = useOnThrottledChange(onThrottledChange, onChange);
<input onChange={throttleCallback} />
```

Make sure to look at the output in the actions tab as you type!
