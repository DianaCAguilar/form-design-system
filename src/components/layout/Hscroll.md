Standard horizontal scrolling that:

- always shows a scrollbar
- adds a fade to sides where content overflows

## Matching the document color
The fade effect should match the background color of the parent that contains the
`Hscroll`. For example, if `Hscroll` is placed on a `haze` background, set the `bgColor`
prop to `'haze'`.
