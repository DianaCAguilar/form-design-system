## Shrinking & growing a `FlexItem`
By default, all `FlexItem` components will grow to fill remaining space within the parent
`Flex`. The boolean prop `shrink` will cause a `FlexItem` to shrink to its content size.


## Controlling alignment/justification
You can use the same `align` and `justify` prop interface from `Flex` to control alignment and justification of individual `FlexItem` components.
