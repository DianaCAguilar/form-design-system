# Popover

Base popover component. Bring your own trigger and popover content.

## What this component does

- Handle events according to `interactionMode` passed in
- Handle positioning of popover content

## What this component does **not** do

- Content styling - the popover container is just a transparent div.
- Arrows. They aren't supported, but we can add them in the future.
